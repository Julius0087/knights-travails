# knights-travails
A TOP script for Knights Travails project
## Description
This repository includes a script for calculating a path for a knight on an 8x8 chess board.
It uses two classes - node and board and works by creating a structure similar to binary search tree.
The knight_moves method can calculate the shortest path for a knight from any starting position to any ending position.
## Thoughts
This assignment was pretty difficlut, but with some thought and pen and paper for sketching things out, it turned out alright.
